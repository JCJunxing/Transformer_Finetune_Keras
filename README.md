# Jupyter Notebooks for Machine Learning with Transformers

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that guide you through various machine learning tasks using the Transformers library. Below is a brief overview of each notebook:

## Notebooks

1. **A Full Training**
   - This notebook demonstrates the complete training process for a machine learning model using the Transformers library.
   - Dependencies: Transformers, Datasets, Evaluate libraries.

2. **Fine-tuning a Model with the Trainer API or Keras**
   - Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained model using the Trainer API provided by the Transformers library.
   - Dependencies: Transformers, Datasets, Evaluate libraries.

3. **Fine-tuning a Model with the Trainer API or Keras (Version 2)**
   - A continuation or alternative approach to fine-tuning models, possibly including different techniques or models.
   - Dependencies: Transformers, Datasets, Evaluate libraries.

4. **Transformers, What Can They Do?**
   - Explore various capabilities and applications of the Transformers library in natural language processing tasks.
   - Dependencies: Transformers, Datasets, Evaluate libraries.
